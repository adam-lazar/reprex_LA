The film Together We Grow was supplied by The Hague residents and entrepreneurs platform Ons Eten in collaboration with the [Food.Film.Fest.](https://www.voedselanders.nl/foodfilmfest2023/) of Voedsel Anders. Urban Agriculture The Hague ([Stadslandbouw Den Haag](https://stadslandbouwdenhaag.nl/)) and [Ons Eten](https://ons-eten.nl/) are both committed to raising awareness about our food system; what do we eat, how good is it for us, where does it come from, does the producer get a fair price, what is needed for production, what is the impact on nature, etc. The films of this festival make you think about these topics and show opportunities.
