**The Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic does not have a register of all existing legal entities in the field of art, culture, and the creative industries, making it difficult to implement measures aimed at the entire sector. Its significance became fully apparent after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic when the ministry needed to target governmental support, but it did not have a complete list of eligible entities.**

## Existing registers
Sectors of cultural heritage (museums, galleries, libraries) – nearing 100% repletion
Art sector (visual arts, theaters, musical entities) – low repletion
Sectors falling under KKP (architecture, design, gaming industry) – no registers
Publicly available data
Register of non-governmental non-profit organizations
Commercial Register
Finstat
Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic

## Expected solution
The output of the hackathon should be a document outlining the method of creating an information system (IS) that will contain registers of legal entities whose main activities have an artistic or cultural character, as well as the method of filling it with data and how to obtain, process, and display this data.

Public and private sections
Automated data collection from search engines based on entered keywords
Manual registration of entities
Categorization of entities by cultural sectors
Import and export of data
Generation of output data for managerial decision-making
Creation of galleries, navigation menus, dynamic pages, and widgets
Automated processing of statistical results
